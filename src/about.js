        <p><i>Presenting a unique experience for our unique clientele.</i></p>
        <p>Here at Bouche de Folle, our patrons enjoy an experience like none other
            Our wait staff, cooks, bartenders, and all memebers of management and ownership are 
            just birds.  That's right.  There are only birds here.  All of our poultry dishes are 
            served with irony on the side.
